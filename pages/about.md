This site has gone through a number of changes over the years.  This was a fun college project that I did in my spare time to explore technology.  It is where I learned PHP and mySQL, most commonly referred to as LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP).  It has also been a test bed for a number of other fun personal projects.  

I have gone through a number of CMS platforms: WordPress, SubText, N2CMS, Umbraco and probably some more.

I have ultimately decided on the [jekyll][jekyll-organization] platform hosted on [github pages][github-pages].  **[Git]** is my favorite version control system that I have worked with; it is a very powerful tool that enhances the software development process.  **[Markdown]** is a great formatting tool for blog posts and documentation in projects.  The merging of these two technologies feels like a big win.

### About Me

I am a father, husband, exercise enthusiast, gamer, and software developer with over 10 years of experience, and a problem solver. I have a lifetime experience of things.

I work primarily on the stack of: C#, Web API, SQL Server, React, and nHibernate.  TDD is one of the most rewarding aspects of Software Development.

I like to use different parts of my brain, so from time-to-time I willÂ write about my personal experiences; sometimes technical; sometimes not.
