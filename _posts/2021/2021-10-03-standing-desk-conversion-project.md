When I worked in an office I had a standing desk and it definitely helped with fatigue and productivity.  I'm sure this is different for each  person, but I find the standing work experience to help keep productivity going.  It will also save some mileage on the chair!

I really liked the L-shaped desk that I have been using, so I decided to upgrade the frame to a standing desk frame and keep the top.  

## Standing Desk Frame

I went with the following standing desk frame from Lovinouse.

What I have liked about this frame so far:

- **Simple** to assembly
- **Solid** -- it is sturdy in all positions (up and down)
    - My desk is actually more sturdy now!
- **Quiet**
    - The 3 motors that power it are not loud
- **Smooth** up/down movement
- **Configurable**
    - Placement of up/down and height memory can me moved
- **Customizable**
    - The widths can be adjusted on either side of this desk

The only issue I ran into was the **shipping** and I do not find that to be a fault of this product.  *Shipping in general has been a mess lately.*

## Wire Management

The desk also comes with *3 or 4* sticky zip ties to help hide the cables under the desk.  These work really well.

I also picked up a couple of wire management baskets to deal with all the wires that I have.

I have a laptop and a desktop on my desk, so dealing with multiple power bricks and cables was a necessity.

## Things to Remember

The important part is to check is if the widths match for the desk you are replacing.  This standing desk frame supports: *47” min. to 71” max., width from 54” min. to 69” max*.  This fell right in the sweet spot of my desk.

Overall the difficulty of doing this replacement felt **moderate at most**.  This is definitely a project that can be completed on a weekend afternoon.

I also added a LED strip underneath to give it a nice glow!  Enjoy!
